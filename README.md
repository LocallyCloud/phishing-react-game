• All companies, people, and emails in this game are fictional or used for training purposes only. Any resemblance to real entities is coincidental.

• This is a safe simulation - your accounts are not affected

## Why I built this:
 • In my cybersecurity classes, I noticed that theory alone isn’t enough — people often fail to recognize phishing in real-world scenarios.

 • I wanted a safe, interactive environment where anyone can practice identifying suspicious emails without risk.

The game covers things like:

 • Malicious links and attachments

 • Spoofed sender addresses

 • Social engineering tactics

 • Urgency & fear-based phishing attempts
